  A music-player web application created in React.js

------
## **About the Project** üîé

A web application for uploading and listening to music. Similar in concept to the [vanilla JavaScript music player](https://github.com/KennethOnuorah/Javascript-Music) I made a while ago, but with additional features. Unlike the previous version that only permitted the uploading of pre-made audio directories from the user's file system, with no way of modifying them once uploaded, this app allows users to create and edit their own playlists.

In order for the app to function properly and to have a good user experience, it is highly recommended that your audio files contain metadata/id3 tag information. You can edit the metadata of your song files by right-clicking them in your file explorer and navigating to **Properties > Details** (or **Edit > Get Info** for Mac users), then edit each tag with the correct information. Or you can visit [tagmp3.net](https://tagmp3.net/).

If, however, you have [Spotify Premium](https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/), [Deezer Premium](https://www.deezer.com/us/offers/premium), [Pandora Premium](https://www.pandora.com/upgrade/premium), or any other premium subscription from a music streaming service, then you can easily download your playlists from there and upload them with the metadata already included. That way, you don't have to go through the trouble of editing each song's tag information.
